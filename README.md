**How the API Works ‚Äì 3 Simple Steps**

1. **Initiate Data Collection**  
   Send a **POST request** to trigger data collection for the requested profile. This step starts the update process in the system.  
   `POST [API_Domain]/v1.1/tiktok/profile/username_example/update?&access_token`

2. **Check Update Status**  
   Send a **GET request** to check the update status. The possible statuses include:  
   **Created** ‚Äì The request is queued.  
   **Pending** ‚Äì The data is being collected.  
   **Finished** ‚Äì The update is complete, and the data is ready.  
   **Fail** ‚Äì The data could not be collected (e.g., the profile does not exist or is not publicly available).  
   **Canceled** ‚Äì –ó–∞–ø–∏—Ç –±—É–≤ –≤—ñ–¥–º—ñ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π  
   **Unknown** ‚Äì The POST request to initiate the update was not received or not accepted.  
   `GET [API_Domain]/v1.1/tiktok/profile/username_example/update?&access_token`

3. **Retrieve Updated Profile Data**  
   Once the update is finished, send a **GET request** to retrieve the latest profile data collected from the platform.
   `GET [API_Domain]/v1.1/tiktok/profile/username_example?access_token`
